Move character with left analog, run by holding down 'b'

Touch the other white character to begin a battle

Each turn you can pick Attack, Recover, Dodge, or Magic
Then, the enemy picks one of those four as well

Combat is mostly played for now in the debug text, very little is shown on screen. Your characters will fall down when out of health, and it will print to the screen if you lose the game.

The combat resolves, resulting in taking damage, healing, or dealing damage depending on the combination of moves.

The three characters are the Wizard (Top), the Warrior (Mid) and the Rogue (Bottom). They are fighing a big snake or something.
